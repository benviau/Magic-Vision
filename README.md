About the author:

I'm Ben Viau, a web developer from NH of about 5 years experience at the onset of this project. 
My goal is to one day build some sort of card sorting robot for my hobby, MTG. I have no prior
experience with mechanical engineering, but I hope for the success of this app to propel my 
endeavors in that aspect of invention.
